# Robot Navigation Using SLAM-ROS
**This Repository will explain my 2nd task in Robotics and AI department at [SMART METHODS](https://github.com/smart-methods) summer training.**

## Task Requirements: 
  * Use [Turtlebot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/#overview) (ROS standard platform robot) with SLAM approach (simultaneous localization and mapping) to creat a map using Lidar sensor and then save the map.
